    <p>
      When your character gains access to a new tier of
      spells (e.g., a wizard obtaining 4th-level spell slots
      at 7th level), all spellcasting classes can choose a
      Signature Spell to showcase the culmination of
      their character’s growth. This spell can be from any
      sourcebook approved by the Dungeon Master, and
      it is recommended that the DM allows a selection
      of books beyond the core rulebooks for players to
      choose from.
    </p>
    <p>
      When selecting a Signature Spell consult with your
      DM to ensure the spell is balanced and appropriate
      for the campaign. If needed, you can work together
      to modify the spell to fit your character’s concept
      and maintain balance within the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chosen Signature Spell is always prepared
      and does not count against the maximum number
      of spells known or prepared, as applicable to your
      character’s class.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a necromancer who enjoys raising undead and using explosives reaches 9th level. They
      might choose a spell like skull bomb (from Book of
      Lost Spells by Frog God Games) as their Signature
      Spell to reflect their unique expertise.
