         This house rule encourages and rewards roleplaying and interaction between players. By actively engaging with each other in character, you increase the likelihood of receiving a D6 Inspiration die or a Luck Point from the DM. Keep in mind that it’s better to use these rewards rather than hoarding them, as you won’t receive another until you’ve used the one you have.

             In addition to rewarding exceptional roleplay, Inspiration or Luck points may also be granted for captivating and imaginative descriptions of finishing moves. Upon prompting the player with the question, “How do you want to do this?” the player is encouraged to describe an extraordinary finisher or a flavorful, emotionally resonant takedown. If the description is deemed impressive, the player may be awarded a D6 Inspiration die or a Luck point as a reward.
